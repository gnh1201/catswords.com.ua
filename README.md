What does Catswords team think of COVID-19 and Russia's invasion of Ukraine?

## COVID-19
Catswords team has publicly provided resources for parsing and visualizing genomic file formats (e.g. FastA) since the spread of MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015.

In 2020, when COVID-19 occurred, we were well aware of its seriousness. We actively shared our experiences related to file parsing and visualization with related agencies. Also, All members have not been doing any offline activities related to Catswords team's mission.

Our offline activities will resume in the fall of 2022 but will be operated on a limited scale.

## Russia's invasion of Ukraine
As soon as we heard this news, we delivered donations to various aid organizations supporting Ukraine. We don't think that the means of owning power for any reason should be to take someone's life.

We hear every day about Russia, Belarus, and the unofficial russia-associated groups that support them. They are relieving their desire for blood with an invasion of Ukraine.

I'm sorry that all we can do is donate a small amount and purchase the UA domain. But we pray for peace in Ukraine.

### Do not make Protestware
We know about Protestware and we've already looked at a few of them. But we think this is an act unrelated to Ukraine aid.

In fact, analyzing Protestware made it easy to find violent symbols such as the Hakenkreuz and Rising-sun flag in internal or related resources. Anyone who creates Protestware can be considered to agree with Hakenkreuz and Rising-sun flag.
